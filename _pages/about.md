I am senior reseaarch scientist working at Data61, CSIRO. Before, I was engaged as an IWY (Impossible Without You) Research Scientist at [CSIRO Data61](https://research.csiro.au/cybersecurity-quantum-systems/people/staff/). Meanwhile, I am an adjunct lecturer at UNSW, visiting researcher at UC Davis and adjunct fellow at RMIT University. Previously, I held a position as a Postdoctoral Researcher at UC Davis, under the mentorship of IEEE Fellow [Junshan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UtAdFs8AAAAJ&hl=en), following a similar stint at Arizona State University.


I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Prof [Flora Salim](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/flora-salim) and Dr Jeffrey Chan, where I focused on spatio-temporal data mining and smart cities. Before that, I obtained my master's degree from the University of Hong Kong with distinction honor.

### Research Interest
AI-Cybersecurity, Graph neural networks, Spatio-temporal data mining, Reinforcement learning application, Large Language Model application and the Internet of Things (IoT).
