I am currently engaged as a Research Scientist at [CSIRO Data61](https://research.csiro.au/cybersecurity-quantum-systems/people/staff/). where I explore a broad spectrum of topics such as cybersecurity, graph neural networks, spatio-temporal data mining, reinforcement learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Previously, I held a position as a Postdoctoral Researcher at UC Davis, under the mentorship of IEEE Fellow [Junshan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UtAdFs8AAAAJ&hl=en), following a similar stint at Arizona State University. A notable project of mine involves the development of a simulation platform designed to evaluate AI algorithms for autonomous vehicles in mixed-traffic scenarios. My research agenda primarily targets edge computing and reinforcement learning applications in autonomous vehicle systems, but it also spans across fairness in graph neural networks, wireless sensing technologies, smart city infrastructures, and the IoT.
