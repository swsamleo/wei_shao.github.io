Dr. Wei Shao is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at UC Davis, where he is working under the guidance of Professor [Junshan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UtAdFs8AAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this role, he worked at Arizona State University, where he was also supervised by Professor Zhang. His current research focuses on developing a reinforcement learning-based simulation platform to investigate artificial intelligence algorithms in mix-road autonomy cars, with a specific focus on edge computing and reinforcement learning with autonomous vehicles. Dr. Shao's research interests include fairness issues in graph neural networks, wireless sensing, the Internet of Things, and smart cities. He is passionate about addressing real-world problems through innovative research results and enjoys solving problems that have both industrial and research value.

Previously, Dr. Shao worked as a Research Fellow at the [Centre for Information Discovery and Data Analytics (CIDDA)](https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/centres-collaborations/centre-for-information-discovery-and-data-analytics) at RMIT, Australia, and was also associated with the [ARC Centre of Excellence in Automated Decision Making and Society (ADMS)](https://www.admscentre.org.au/).

Dr. Shao obtained his Ph.D. from RMIT, where he was supervised by Professor [Salim](https://fsalim.github.io/) and Dr. Chan and was awarded a scholarship from the Sustainable Urban Precincts Program (SUPP) project. He also served as a Research Assistant in the Computer Science Department at the University of Hong Kong, where he carried out an Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) project. Dr. Shao received a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Hong Kong, where he graduated with distinction.
