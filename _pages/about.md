Dr. Wei Shao, currently a Research Scientist at CSIRO Data61, delves into a myriad of areas including network security, graph neural networks, spatio-temporal data mining, reinforcement learning, and the Internet of Things. Before this, he served as a Postdoctoral Researcher at UC Davis, mentored by Professor [Junshan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UtAdFs8AAAAJ&hl=en), following a similar collaboration at Arizona State University. One of Dr. Shao's standout projects involves creating a simulation platform that uses reinforcement learning to analyze AI algorithms in mixed-road autonomous vehicles. While his research primarily focuses on edge computing and reinforcement learning in autonomous vehicles, it also encompasses fairness in graph neural networks, wireless sensing, smart cities, and the Internet of Things.


Motivated by a passion to address real-world challenges, Dr. Shao seeks opportunities that merge industrial relevance with academic significance. He has previously contributed as a Research Fellow at RMIT's Centre for Information Discovery and Data Analytics (CIDDA) and was affiliated with the ARC Centre of Excellence in Automated Decision Making and Society (ADMS).


Dr. Shao earned his Ph.D. from RMIT under the guidance of Professor [Flora Salim](https://fsalim.github.io/) and Dr. Chan, supported by a scholarship from the Sustainable Urban Precincts Program (SUPP) project. Additionally, he holds a Master of Science in Computer Science with distinction from the University of Hong Kong, where he also served as a Research Assistant and contributed to an Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) project.
