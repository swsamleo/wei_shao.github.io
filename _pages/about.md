Dr Wei Shao is working as a Research Fellow at [CIDDA](https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/centres-collaborations/centre-for-information-discovery-and-data-analytics), RMIT now. I am now working in the [ARC Centre of Excellence in Automated Decision Making and Society (ADMS)](https://www.admscentre.org.au/). My research interest includes fairness issue in machine learning, wireless sensing, reinforcement learning in routing system, Internet of Things, and smart cities.

I obtained PhD in the RMIT supervised by [Prof. Salim](https://fsalim.github.io/) and Dr. Chan. I was awarded the scholarship from [SUPP](https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2015/may/making-connections/meet-our-green-team) project. I worked as a Researcher Assistant at the University of Hong Kong from 2012 to 2014 in Computer Science department. I was carrying out an [ITF](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.itf.gov.hk%2Fl-eng%2FWhatsNew.asp%3Ftextmode%3D0&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNELhLKEdHv4J7F9L9gmz-weK58d6g) project involved topics include human detection, tracking and also interactive segmentation inside videos. These works were financed under ITF project sponsored by The Government of Hong Kong, Microsoft, Astri and etc. I received the Master of Science ( *pass with distinction* ) in Computer Science (CS) of The University of Hong Kong.
