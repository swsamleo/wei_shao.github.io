title: "Spatio-temporal Data Analytic for Situation Awareness in Airport Operations"
excerpt: "Situation awareness (SA) is vital to effective decision making in complex and dynamic sensed
environments. The pervasiveness of distributed sensor systems in airport operations is generating
significant amounts of heterogeneous data that, correctly handled, can offer significant insights for
SA across a wide range of scenarios. This research aims to develop robust techniques and tools to discover spatio-temporal patterns from a variety of airport sensor data and complementary data sources to inform and improve situation
awareness in airport ground operations. ![img2](images/LAX-withArrow.png)"
