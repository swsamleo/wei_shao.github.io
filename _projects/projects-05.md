title: "Device-free Human Identification in the Office"
excerpt: "Recently, door access control with Internet of Things (IoT) has become increasingly popular in the field of security. However, conventional approaches such as video-based or biological information based cannot satisfy the requirements of personal privacy protection in the modern society. Hence, a wireless signal based technique which does not need users to carry any devices, called device-free have been introduced in recent years to detect and identify persons. In this paper, we present BLEDoorGuard, a wireless, invisible and robust door access system which leverages received signal strength indicator (RSSI) from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to recognise a person who accesses a door. We evaluated BLEDoorGuard in two real world scenarios: the first is an office with a key lock, and the second is a meeting room with swipe card access. We exploit the characteristics of use of BLE for person identification and propose a two-step algorithm with multiple classifiers. ![img1](images/BlueGuard.png)"
