title: "Mornington Smarter Cities and Suburbs Project (SCSP) project"
excerpt: "The Mornington Peninsula Shire (MPS) has developed a Smart Technology project to address growing demand on parking and amenity facilities in towns particularly with high tourist attraction. There is an increasing pressure to understand the volume of pedestrians, public transport users, and road users (in particular, private vehicle drivers) throughout the major townships in MPS and meet the increasing demand . The ability to model future scenarios will provide a basis to plan infrastructure, provide better routing recommendations, and to assist the planning of events throughout the Shire . Latest smart technology has been sourced along with high - level expertise to develop the necessary systems to gather and translate data into productive outcomes to provide better service s to the community and tourists. The targeted parking and amenities in the high demand towns have varying operations that need specific sensor types to provide the required data. Consequently, the sensor s will require the development and implementation of a tailored system to gather the data and provide information for the community, visitors , Council service teams and planners. This project will allow the Shire to demonstrate the use of smart technologies to improve liveability of busy towns and to enable informed decision making . This will lead to the replication and scaling up of the systems for other towns with high demand pressures throughout the Shire and other councils. <br/><img src='/images/Project_plan_MPS_v12.jpg'>"
