title: "Travelling Officer Problem"
excerpt: "The  on-street  parking  system  is  an  indispensable part  of  civil  projects,  which  provides  travelers  and  shoppers with parking spaces. With the recent in-ground sensors deployed throughout the city, there is a significant problem on how to use the sensor data to manage parking violations and issue infringement  notices  in  a  short  time-window  efficiently.  In  this  project, we  use  a  large  real-world  dataset  with  on-street  parking  sensor data  from  the  local  city  council,  and  propose a new combinatorial optimisation problem called Travelling  Officer  Problem which is widely existed in the real-world. ![img1](images/map_car_man.png)"
